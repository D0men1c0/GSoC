You can even run a tor relay on a raspberry pi but if you would like to push really much traffic through it then you need a VPS and at best close to the authorities.
You can run Tor on all supported OS. Linux is the most common one but relying too much on one OS could be dangerous if there are security holes in it.

Tor,Syndicate,33036,Tor browser,2019-11-06,1900-01-01 00:00:00,0.0,0.0,Syndicate,33036,"Tor Browser 9.0 is now available from the Tor Browser download page and also from our distribution directory.

This release features important security updates to Firefox.

Tor Browser 9.0 is the first stable release based on Firefox 68 ESR and contains a number of updates to other components as well (including Tor to 0.4.1.6 and OpenSSL to 1.1.1d for desktop versions and Tor to 0.4.1.5 for Android).

In addition to all the needed patch rebasing and toolchain updates, we made big improvements to make Tor Browser work better for you.

We want everyone in the world to be able to enjoy the privacy and freedom online Tor provides, and that's why over the past couple years, we've been working hard to boost our UX and localization efforts, with the biggest gains first visible in Tor Browser 8.0.

In Tor Browser 9.0, we continue to build upon those efforts with sleeker integration and additional localization support.

Goodbye, Onion Button
We want your experience using Tor to be fully integrated within the browser so how you use Tor is more intuitive. That's why now, rather than using the onion button that was in the toolbar, you can see your path through the Tor network and request a New Circuit through the Tor network in {i} on the URL bar.

Hello, New Identity Button
Instead of going into the onion button to request a New Identity, we've made this important feature easier to access by giving it its own button in the toolbar.

You can also request a New Identity, and a New Circuit, from within the [=] menu on the toolbar.

Torbutton and Tor Launcher Integration
Now that both extensions are tightly integrated into Tor Browser, they'll no longer be found on the about:addons page.

We redesigned the bridge and proxy configuration dialogs and include them directly into the browser's preference settings as well.

Rather than being a submenu behind the onion button, Tor Network Settings, including the ability to fetch bridges to bypass censorship where Tor is blocked, are easier to access on about:preferences#tor.

Letterboxing
Tor Browser in its default mode is starting with a content window rounded to a multiple of 200px x 100px  to prevent fingerprinting the screen dimensions. The strategy here is to put all users in a couple of buckets to make it harder to single them out. That worked so far until users started to resize their windows (e.g. by maximizing them or going into fullscreen mode). Tor Browser 9 ships with a fingerprinting defense for those scenarios as well, which is called Letterboxing, a technique developed by Mozilla and presented earlier this year. It works by adding white margins to a browser window so that the window is as close as possible to the desired size while users are still in a couple of screen size buckets that prevent singling them out with the help of screen dimensions.

Better Localization Support
If we want all people around the world to be able to use our software, then we need to make sure it's speaking their language. Since 8.0, Tor Browser has been available in 25 languages and we added 5 locales more in Tor Browser 8.5. Today, we add support for two additional languages: Macedonian (mk) and Romanian (ro), bringing the number of supported languages to 32.

We also fixed bugs in our previously shipped localized bundles (such as ar and ko).

Many thanks to everyone who helped with these, in particular to our translators.

Known Issue
As usual when preparing Tor Browser releases, we verified that the build is bit-for-bit reproducible. While we managed to get two matching builds, we found that in some occasions the builds differ (we found this happening on the Linux i686 and macOS bundles). We are still investigating the cause of this issue to fix it.",2019-10-30,hacking,0.16655434668064117,fraud,0.11005965620279312,trafficking,0.06932303309440613

Tor,JACKJACK,404,Onion Service operator mitigate DDoS Attacks article,2020-01-09,2018-04-10 00:00:00,2129.0,681.0,JACKJACK,404,"Since late last October 2018, onion service operators have been on the receiving end of numerous DoS and DDoS attacks, both on the deep web onion service and also on the clear net websites.
The Dos and DDoS attacks have generally alternated between the deep web and the clear net over the span of a couple of days and as things stand now, the motivation behind the attacks are anyone’s guesses.

Definition of Terms

DoS means Denial of Service. Typically, a DoS attack involves the flooding of a server or network with traffic from a single device as a way of drastically crippling the website and making it unable to serve legitimate traffic.
Depending on the magnitude of the attack and the capabilities of the server or network, the flooding often gets too overwhelming and forces the website to go offline for a period ranging from a few hours to months.
DDoS stands for Distributed Denial of Service. Like DoS attacks, it seeks to cripple the target’s server by sending it tons of traffic.
Your TOR usage is being watched

Unlike DoS, however, DDoS deploys several devices from all over the internet, DDoS usually infected with malware to serve that exact same purpose, to launch the attacks to the specific server or network.

As such, they can be quite a headache to handle for onion service operators.


Attacks Utilize Onion Services’ Only Weakness
ddos presented in the form of binary code 3d illustration
Mitigating DDoS Attacks Against Your Onion Service.

When carried out properly, DoS and DDoS attacks are very effective ways to bring down a victim’s server and consequently disrupt their services or halt their operations for a period of time.
Ironically, it is much easier to block DDoS and DoS attacks on clearnet websites than it is for onion services to mitigate them.
This is because in clearnet websites one is able to access individual connection information such as IP addresses and geographic locations, single them out, drop the connection(s) and prevent it from reconnecting.

For onion services, however, this is a luxury they cannot afford.

Simply put, the design of onion services that prevents them from accessing individual connection information becomes a flaw when it comes to mitigating DDoS and DoS attacks because it is impossible to single out an IP address or a geographic location.

There is only one connection that can be seen by the server and block it means blocking out everybody else using it, which is exactly what the attackers want anyway.

How Can Onion Servers Prevent/Deal with DDoS and DoS Attacks?

Seeing that the DoS and DDoS attacks rely on overwhelming both the resources of your network and the capabilities of your server, upgrading them will help to significantly reduce the impact of the resource-limiting DDoS and DoS attacks.DDoS attacks especially seem to target the network speed of onion services more than anything.As a result, there are hardly any performance tweaks to be undertaken that can reduce the impact of a DDoS attack that focuses mainly on disabling the network speeds.Onion services can, however, adopt a number of safety and counter-measures to ensure that they survive DDoS and DoS attacks.

1. Constantly Update Your System

Getting on the mailing list for services such as Tor is important for onion services.
This is because recent upgrades often address some of the biggest vulnerabilities of the onion router and you would be on the safer side if you got the upgrades as soon as possible.
Tor’s most recent release 0.2.8.9 for example, came as a relief for many users as it fixed a crucial weakness that was being utilized by remote hackers.

2. Upgrade Your Software as Well crucial 

Most onion service operators fail to see the simple yet vital importance of upgrading their services.
A powerful server can only do as much when it comes to withstanding heavy influxes of traffic, but improving the software as well can also help mitigate heavy DDoS attacks.
Some of the recommended upgrades include Nginx for apache users, and PHP 7 from the much slower PHP 5.6 in order to triple server response capabilities while reducing memory usage.

3Monitor Your Information Logs

Logs will help you identify deficiencies with pinpoint accuracy and provide insight on the type of configuration you can go in to make things run a bit smoother.
In the event of Dos and DDoS attack, onion service operators should also avoid piling on to the problem by rate limiting or using code solutions, as these often result in the failing of the server.

4. Tor Limits Bandwidth During the First Few Months

When onion service operators introduce their sites to Tor, it gradually increases the site traffic over time, meaning that it might take a while before your network usage picks up speed.
Using anti-bot repellents is one effective way for users to speed up the process and enjoy full network usage sooner.
To summarize, the best an onion service operator can do to mitigate DDoS and DoS attacks is to improve their service in anticipation of an attack so that they can absorb as much of the influx of traffic as possible without shutting down operations.",2019-08-06,tor problems,0.15086138248443604,hacking,0.13126292824745178,find vendor,0.06124252825975418

Tor Browser 8.5a4 is now available from the Tor Browser Project page and also from our distribution directory.

This release features important security updates to Firefox.

Highlights in Tor Browser 8.5a4 are a new Tor alpha version, 0.3.5.3-alpha, a fixed layout of our macOS installer window and Stylo (Mozilla's new CSS engine) being enabled on macOS after fixing a reproducibility issues. Please report any problems you find with those macOS related changes as we think about backporting them for the stable series.

Moreover, we backport a defense against protocol handler enumeration developed by Mozilla engineers and provide Tor Browser on all supported platforms in four additional locales: cs, el, hu, and ka.

Note: It turned out it was a bit premature to ship the new locales as we did not catch bugs in them last minute, so we don't make them available on our download page. Sorry for the inconvenience.
